Diabetes is a chronic illness affecting many people and is characterized by the presence of high blood sugar levels. Early detection is important since diabetes detected in early stages can be controlled by lifestyle changes and/or minimal medication. Diabetes prediction serves as a useful reference for doctors because they can order further tests to detect diabetes early.
